                <p>If you like the essay, then you'll definitely want to take a look at Luc
Steels's <em>The Talking Heads Experiment: Origins of Words and Meanings</em>. It's
published as an open-access book by Language Science Press, so
<a href="http://langsci-press.org//catalog/book/49">go grab the free download</a>!</p>
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>The essay analyzes why Noam Chomsky’s notion of language (both its
essence — language as a set of grammatical sentences — and genesis)
leads neither to interesting discoveries nor even to useful questions
from the point of view of linguistics as a science. A much more fruitful
approach to language is to view it as a complex, dynamic, distributed
system with emergent properties stemming from its functions, as
advocated e.g. by Luc Steels. The argument will be developed against the
backdrop of the evolution of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s thought, from the
<em>Tractatus</em> to the concept of language games, i.e. from an approach to
language based on thorough formal analysis but also misconceptions about
its functions, to a much keener though less formal grasp of its praxis
and purpose.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>At least since Thomas Kuhn’s <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>,
it has been a fairly commonplace notion that working within the confines
of a particular scientific paradigm conditions to a certain extent the
questions one is likely to ask and therefore also the answers that
ensue. This effectively limits the range of possible discoveries,
because some are not answers to meaningful questions within a given
framework while other observations still are taken as given axioms,
which means they cannot be the target of further scientific
investigation.</p>
<p>In contemporary linguistics, one very prominent such paradigm is that of
<em>generative grammar</em>, single-handedly established in 1957 by Noam
Chomsky in his seminal work <em>Syntactic Structures</em>. While serious
criticism has been leveled over time against this initial exposition as
well as Chomsky’s subsequent elaborations on it (see Pullum 2011;
Sampson 2015; and Sampson 2005 for a book-length treatment), the book
undeniably attracted significant numbers of brilliant young minds under
the wings of its research program, which went from aspiring challenger
in the domain of linguistics to established heavyweight in a
comparatively short period of time (the transition had been achieved by
the mid-1970s at the latest). In the process, it co-opted or spawned
various other sub-fields of linguistics, and even rebranded itself, such
that <em>Cartesian linguistics</em>, <em>cognitive linguistics</em> and most recently
<em>biolinguistics</em> are all labels which suggest a strong generativist
presence.</p>
<p>One serious competitor to the Chomskyan account of language that has
emerged over the years is the field of <em>evolutionary linguistics</em>. It
might seem strange at first glance why biolinguistics and evolutionary
linguistics should be at odds. As their names indicate, they both aspire
to a close relationship with biology, which seems to indicate their
research agendas and outlooks should largely overlap. Yet their
fundamental assumptions about what constitutes language are so
irreconcilable that they might as well be considered to deal with
different objects of study. Of the two, it is evolutionary linguistics
which leads to questions and investigations which can be conceived of as
scientific (in the Popperian sense of involving falsifiable hypotheses
instead of being merely speculative), consequently yielding the most
useful insights – in the fairly pedestrian sense that these can be
intersubjectively replicated without resorting to an argument from
authority, which makes them a better foundation to build upon, because
the superadded structures are less likely to crumble should said
authority ever change their mind, as Chomsky has done several times
already.</p>
<h1>Wittgenstein on language: From logical calculus to language games</h1>
<p>Let us now take a short détour through the development of Ludwig
Wittgenstein’s thoughts on language, so that we may couch our later
discussion of the differences between generative grammar /
biolinguistics and evolutionary linguistics in terms of a contrast that
is perhaps more familiar. The imagery in the title of the present essay
was borrowed from Eric S. Raymond’s book <em>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar:
Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary</em>
(Raymond 1999). In it, Raymond describes two models of collaborative
software development, one of them very rigid, restrictive and hostile to
newcomers (the “cathedral”), the other overwhelmingly inclusive, open to
outside contributions and organic change, an effervescent hive of
activity (the “bazaar”), whose unexpected but empirically demonstrable
virtues he has come to embrace.</p>
<p>This architectural metaphor also happens to be very apt when
characterizing Wittgenstein’s view of language in the two major stages
of his thought, as represented by his two books <em>Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus</em> and <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. In the
<em>Tractatus</em>, Wittgenstein has a “preconceived idea of language as an
exact calculus operated according to precise rules” (McGinn 2006, 12)
and formalizing this system of rules leads him to the following dogmatic
conclusion: “what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we
cannot talk about we must pass over in silence” (Wittgenstein 2001, 3).
The deontic force of the final injunction should be taken with a grain
of salt; it could perhaps be rephrased in the following less
epigraph-worthy manner: there is a sharp logical boundary to be drawn
between meaningful and nonsensical propositions, and the purpose of
language is to construct meaningful ones, therefore it is futile (rather
than strictly forbidden) to engage in nonsensical ones.</p>
<p>There have been attempts to read the <em>Tractatus</em> in an ironic mode, as a
consciously doomed, self-defeating attempt to circumscribe the limits to
the expression of thought, which prefigures the much more subtle
attitude towards language that Wittgenstein later exhibits in the
<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> (see McGinn 2006, 5–6 and elsewhere for
an overview of this so-called “resolute” reading). In my opinion, such a
stance exhibits a blatant, possibly wilful disregard of his almost
penitent tone in the preface to <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>: “I could
not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out in that first book”
(Wittgenstein 2009, 4e).</p>
<p>Where does Wittgenstein think he went wrong then? Arguably, the most
serious misconception was conferring a privileged ontological status to
language, seeing it as “the unique correlate, picture, of the world”
(Wittgenstein 2009, 49e), whereas in fact, these referential properties
are highly dependent on communicative context. It signifies only insofar
as it has an effect on the addressee (another human being, or even
myself) which to all practical intents and purposes the speaker can
identify as somehow related to what she was trying to achieve with her
utterance in the first place. But there is little meaning, in any
practical sense, outside these highly particular, localized (in both
physical and cultural space and time), embodied, grounded interactions.
Wittgenstein calls these interactions “language-games” to “emphasize the
fact that the <em>speaking</em> of language is part of an activity, or of a
form of life” (Wittgenstein 2009, 15e, original emphasis). Of course,
the notion of game still involves some kind of rules, but by focusing on
the activity rather than its regulations, it is much easier to account
for “the case where we play, and make up the rules as we go along […]
and even where we alter them – as we go along” (Wittgenstein 2009, 44e).</p>
<p>This is not to say that we cannot construct abstractions, although
Wittgenstein himself is clearly in favor of systematically examining
particular cases: “In order to see more clearly, here as in countless
similar cases, we must look at what really happens <em>in detail</em>, as it
were from close up” (Wittgenstein 2009, 30e). However, once we do
abstract away, it is crucial to approach the resulting theory from a
pragmatic standpoint: “We want to establish an order in our knowledge of
language: an order for a particular purpose, one out of many possible
orders, not <em>the</em> order” (Wittgenstein 2009, 56e, original emphasis).</p>
<h1>Generative grammar</h1>
<p>In many ways, Chomsky conceives of language as the early Wittgenstein
did, i.e. under the cathedral metaphor. This may come across as a
surprise because unlike Wittgenstein, he is not concerned with issues of
meaningfulness, philosophical or otherwise. Indeed, it is one of his
fundamental precepts that grammar can and should be dissociated from
meaning, as demonstrated by his famous example sentence “Colorless green
ideas sleep furiously”, which he claims is perfectly grammatical yet
meaningless<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> (Chomsky 2002, Chap. 2).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the goal for both is to describe language <em>per se</em>, in the
abstract, without regard to its context-grounded use in actual
communication. Both strive to give a highly formal definition of the
system they think they are uncovering: while Wittgenstein attempts to
establish a logical calculus of how propositions can be said to carry
meaning in terms of their referential relationship to external reality,
Chomsky tries to hint at a calculus which would determine which
candidate sentences belong to the language encoded by this calculus,
i.e. separate those that are grammatical from those that are not.</p>
<p>Another way to put this is that the descriptive part of linguistics can
be equated with formal language theory: a language is viewed as a
(potentially infinite) set of symbol strings (sentences), and the
linguist’s task is to find the simplest and most elegant set of rules
that would constitute the basis for a procedure to generate (hence
<em>generative</em> grammar) all of them and only those, whether observed or
potential. Chomsky himself gives the following definition: “by a
generative grammar I mean simply a system of rules that in some explicit
and well-defined way assigns structural descriptions to sentences”
(Chomsky 1965, 8).</p>
<p>Furthermore, “Linguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal
speaker-listener, in a completely homogeneous speech-community, who
knows its language perfectly” (Chomsky 1965, 3). Specifically, it is
concerned with his “<em>competence</em> (the speaker-hearer’s [intrinsic]
knowledge of his language)”, not his “<em>performance</em> (the actual use of
language in concrete situations)” (Chomsky 1965, 4). Additionally, no
claim is made as to the cognitive or neurophysiological accuracy of the
mechanisms described, although to hedge his bets both ways, Chomsky adds
that “No doubt, a reasonable model of language use will incorporate, as
a basic component, the generative grammar that expresses the
speaker-hearer’s knowledge of the language” (Chomsky 1965, 9).</p>
<p>In short, Chomsky consciously sets up the playing field for a thoroughly
mentalistic, speculative discipline. At first, it might seem like
reasonable approximation and a small concession to make, especially in
the face of the sheer daunting complexity of all the intricate
mechanisms that conspire to yield the phenomenon we call language, but
only until one fully realizes the consequences of such a move. Observe
for instance the carefully crafted loophole claiming that linguistics is
primarily concerned with an ideal speaker-hearer’s competence and that
actual usage data is just circumstantial evidence. This effectively
allows linguists to dismiss inconvenient edge cases or counterexamples
to their theories purely on grounds of their being noisy data or slips
of the tongue, which is something they are allowed to determine based on
introspection. Mind you, this is not just a theoretical loophole;
Chomsky himself has repeatedly relied on it, especially with respect to
so-called linguistic universals (see e.g. Sampson 2005, 139 or 160).</p>
<p>The net result is rampant, unchecked theorizing. One such example is the
postulation of a two-layer linguistic analysis, the observed language
data corresponding to a surface structure which provides hints as to an
underlying, more regular deep structure to be uncovered. The deep
structure is purportedly closer to the universal properties of language;
both layers are linked by a system of transformations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can greatly simplify the description of English and gain new and important
insight into its formal structure if we limit the direct description in terms
of phrase structure to a kernel of basic sentences (simple, declarative,
active, with no complex verb or noun phrases), deriving all other sentences
from these (more properly, from the strings that underlie them) by
transformation, possibly repeated. (Chomsky 2002, 106–7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Constructing a formal framework for grammar modeling with cognitively
unmotivated levels of abstraction might have been a valid goal (though
arguably not within linguistics) if the result was indeed, as Chomsky
claims it to be, maximally elegant, as simple as can be but no simpler.
I was not able to track down a formal definition of this criterion, but
simplicity is clearly discursively construed as a desirable quality:
“simple and revealing” (Chomsky 2002, 11) or “effective and
illuminating” (Chomsky 2002, 13) are Chomsky’s choice epithets for what
to look for in a grammar. But that is not true either: transformations
are an unnecessary addition, singling them out as a separate category of
operations adds nothing to the generative power of his system (Pullum
2011, 290). They are therefore a wart under any reasonable definition of
“simplicity” and Chomsky thus manages to fall short of even the
self-defined, theory-internal standards that are the only ones he allows
his enterprise to be held to.</p>
<h1>Ontogeny and phylogeny</h1>
<p>As we have seen, generative grammar concerns itself with an ideal
speaker-hearer’s competence in a perfectly homogeneous community. The
trouble is that such an impoverished model eschews any possibility of
dynamism. The very dichotomy between grammatical and ungrammatical is
intuitively problematic if we consider that judgments are bound to
diverge when made in reference to different dialects, sociolects and
idiolects,<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> not to mention that binary classification might be too
reductive in some cases (how would you categorize, on first encounter, a
construction which you passively understand but would never produce
actively?). Though Chomsky sometimes mentions in passing the possibility
of levels of grammaticalness which would allow a finer-grained analysis
(e.g. Chomsky 2002, 16; Chomsky 1965, 11), it seems to be just another
instance of hedging his bets, he never makes it a fundamental component
of his theory. This would seem to indicate that Chomsky’s theory of
language has a serious problem in that it is unable to account for any
phenomena that involve fluctuations in linguistic ability, including
language emergence / diachronic change (phylogeny) and acquisition
(ontogeny).</p>
<p>Chomsky’s response to this is that our language faculty is largely
innate: we are genetically endowed with a <em>language-acquisition device</em>
in our brains (Chomsky 1965, 31–33) which can supposedly infer the
correct grammatical rules even given incomplete, limited and noisy
input, which is what Chomsky argues children get (the “poverty of
stimulus” argument), thanks to strong universal constraints on what a
human language can be like. Under this account, the capacity for
language, initially “a language of thought, later externalized and used
in many ways” (Chomsky 2007, 24), appeared as a random mutation in a
single individual and progressively spread through the population
because it offered a considerable competitive advantage: “capacities for
complex thought, planning, interpretation” (Chomsky 2007, 22).</p>
<p>In his later career, Chomsky increasingly focused on exploring this
purported shared genetic basis for human language, hence the
aforementioned label “biolinguistics”. Make no mistake, this in no way
entails a turn from mentalism towards empirical neurophysiological or
genetic investigation. Quite to the contrary, liberated from the
constraints of having to account for individual existing languages in
detail, he soars to new heights of abstractness in postulating the
formal language underpinnings of human language. The <em>principles and
parameters</em> model of Universal Grammar (Chomsky 1986) expands upon the
notion of linguistic universals by splitting them up into two sets:
principles, which are hardwired and immutable, and parameters, which are
hardwired too but can be flipped on or off based on linguistic behavior
observed by the child in her particular language community. Since the
choices are heavily constrained, the learner can infer correct parameter
settings in spite of deficient input. This line of research culminates
in the so-called <em>minimalist program</em> (Chomsky 1995), where Chomsky
identifies the “core principle of language, [the operation of]
unbounded Merge” (Chomsky 2007, 22). Under the “strong” minimalist
hypothesis, this would be the only principle necessary to account for
human-like languages (Chomsky 2007, 20), which would paradoxically
essentially discard all work (or should I say speculation?) previously
done on the parameters side of the Universal Grammar project. All other
universal characteristics of language could then be explained by newly
introduced “interface” conditions,<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> i.e. constraints on how language
inter-operates with other systems, including thought and physical
language production (Chomsky 2007, 14);<sup id="fnref-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> all empirically documented
variation between the world’s languages would be chalked up to lexical
differences (Chomsky 2007, 25).</p>
<p>The poverty of stimulus and language universals arguments for innateness
have been thoroughly debunked, especially in Geoffrey Sampson’s
book-length diatribe <em>The </em>‘<em>Language Instinct</em>’<em> Debate</em>. In short, it
turns out that some of the grammatical constructions which were assumed
to be absent from a language learner’s input yet acquired nonetheless
have since been empirically proven to occur fairly commonly (Sampson
2005, 72–79). Moreover, there is no qualitative difference between a
statement like “the stimulus is too poor to allow language learning
without a genetic basis” and “the stimulus is just rich enough etc.”,
both are unverifiable unless we have already independently proven that
language learning occurs one way or the other, so to adduce either of
the statements as proof for the hypothesis at stake is misguided
(Sampson 2005, 47–48). Finally, the alleged language universals turn out
to be either false when checked against additional languages (Sampson
2005, 138–9) or so general as to be meaningless (Sampson 2005, Chap. 5).</p>
<p>Irrespective of this, let us suppose for a moment that genetic mutation
and subsequent inheritance do play a role in the emergence of language,
and work out an account of language emergence consistent with this
hypothesis. If language started out through mutation in a single
individual as a purely internal advanced conceptualization faculty, then
once it started to spread, what was the motivation for the
genetically-endowed humans to externalize their thoughts? How did they
know to which of their peers they could speak (which had inherited the
mutation) and which not? And most importantly, how did they know which
parameters of Universal Grammar to flip on and which off, if there was
no prior language based on which to decide? Universal Grammar would have
had to be fairly detailed in order for intersubjective agreement on the
norms for the first ever human language to be reached on the basis of it
alone. Yet as we have seen, Chomsky has been moving away from this
notion – at the limit, the minimalist program posits only one very
general mechanism required for language. The poverty of stimulus
argument is turned against its creator as the argument from poverty of
the machinery supposed to make up for the poverty of said stimulus.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we fully subscribe to the minimalist program and the
notion that all the surface variety exhibited by language comes from the
lexicon, then how are individual words created, how do they propagate?
One might be tempted to say “people just invented them”, but consider
for a while that in the current setup, there is absolutely no mechanism
that would explain how a community of speakers reaches agreement on
their lexicon – this theory offers no incentive whatsoever for consensus
to be reached; from its point of view, a solution where each speaker
ends up with their own private lexicon is equally valid because
indistinguishable on the basis of the theory’s conceptual apparatus.
Chomsky’s ideas on phylogenesis appear thoroughly ridiculous when fully
carried out to their logical consequences, and this can all be blamed on
his sterile, idealized and static view of language which dismisses
actual communication as a secondary purpose and therefore a peripheral
issue.</p>
<p>On a side note, it is hard to say which aspect of Chomsky’s theory of
language came first – whether innateness accommodated the mentalism and
the concomitant quest for formal purity (botched as it may be) of
generative grammar, whether it was the other way round, or whether they
perhaps co-evolved in his mind. The facts are that Chomsky’s initial
publications on generative grammar concentrate on the formal language
theory part (Chomsky 1956; Chomsky 2002), but he added the innateness
argument fairly early on, even tacking a seemingly respectable
philosophical lineage onto it in <em>Cartesian Linguistics</em> (Chomsky 2009),
which pretends to trace back both innateness and mentalism to Descartes
and the Port-Royal grammarians, binding them as two sides of the same
coin. It is worth noting that in both formal language theory and history
of linguistics / philosophy, Chomsky is more of a dabbler than an
expert: he has provably borrowed most of his ideas in the former field
from others, sometimes mangling them or extending them in unfortunate
ways (Pullum 2011; Sampson 2015), and has thoroughly underresearched (or
wilfully twisted?) his understanding of the latter, which has resulted
in serious misrepresentations of the history of ideas (Miel 1969;
Aarsleff 1970).</p>
<h1>Evolutionary linguistics</h1>
<p>There are various sub-fields of linguistics which are in discord with
generative grammar, especially over the notion that performance data
should be used only as evidence for guiding the speculation and detailed
usage and frequency patterns should be disregarded; the primacy of
syntax (as advocated by Chomsky) is also disputed. One of these
sub-fields is obviously corpus linguistics, which takes a decidedly
empiricist stance and starts by assembling a large body of language data
(a corpus) from which patterns of language use are inferred.
Nevertheless, not all of these compete with generative grammar at the
fundamental explanatory level of how language came about
phylogenetically and how it is transmitted by ontogenetic acquisition.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly encountered Chomsky’s emphasis on how communication,
actual interactions between speakers, are just an afterthought in the
system of language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>evolutionary biologist Salvador Luria was the most forceful advocate of the
view that communicative needs would not have provided “any great selective
pressure to produce a system such as language,” with its crucial relation to
“development of abstract or productive thinking.” His fellow Nobel laureate
François Jacob (1977) added later that “the role of language as a
communication system between individuals would have come about only
secondarily, as many linguists believe,” (Chomsky 2007, 23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of this vehemence dovetails with the single individual mutation
hypothesis of the origins of language – it helps if the significance of
communication is downplayed in an account where communication is
initially impossible, simply because there is no other language-endowed
being to communicate with. If communication were language’s killer
feature, then the selective pressure for the incriminated gene to
propagate would not kick in.</p>
<p>The other part can reasonably be attributed to Chomsky’s intent to make
a clean break from a prior popular theory on language acquisition,
epitomized by B. F. Skinner’s 1957 monograph <em>Verbal Behavior</em>, which
offered a heavily empiricist, behaviorist account of language learning
in terms of a stimulus-response cycle. Characteristically, Chomsky’s
strategy is to trivialize the function of the stimulus, casually
implying both that it might not be needed at all, and if it is, then
details of the role it plays are of little interest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it would not be at all surprising to find that normal language learning
requires use of language in real-life situations, in some way. But this, if
true [sic!], would not be sufficient to show that information regarding
situational context (in particular, a pairing of signals with structural
descriptions that is at least in part prior to assumptions about syntactic
structure) plays any role in determining how language is acquired, once the
mechanism is put to work and the task of language learning is undertaken by
the child. (Chomsky 1965, 33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, Skinner’s account may be simplistic in many ways, but the
basic notion that one has to pay attention to stimuli and responses in
the course of particular linguistic interactions is sound. In
particular, a theory of language built on this foundation successfully
copes with all of the impasses we have explored above regarding
Chomsky’s approach. One such framework is that of evolutionary
linguistics.</p>
<p>Evolutionary linguistics views language as a <em>complex adaptive system</em>
with <em>emergent properties</em> (Steels 2015, 8–9). A complex adaptive system
is a system which is not centrally organized, coordinated or designed:
its “macroscopic” characteristics are said to “emerge” as the result of
localized interactions between individual entities (agents) with similar
“microscopic” characteristics (be they physical, behavioral or
motivational). The whole is more than the sum of its parts, and none of
the agents can be properly said to have designed the system, nor can
they deliberately change it in an arbitrary way; but all are
continuously shaping it by taking part in the interactions that
constitute its fabric. Examples of complex adaptive systems include the
dynamics of insect societies (beehives, ant nests) or patterns of
collective motion in large animal groups (flocks of birds or shoals of
fish). These and more are discussed in much greater depth in the first
chapter of Pierre-Yves Oudeyer’s book <em>Self-Organization in the
Evolution of Speech</em>. Adaptiveness is a property that these systems
acquire by virtue of not being hardwired on the macro level: they are
defined functionally instead of structurally. If the conditions in the
environment change, the system will adapt to keep fulfilling its
function, because the agents are forced to modify their behavior in
order to achieve their individual goals. Of course, they may fail to do
so, in which case the system breaks down and ceases to exist.</p>
<p>If we revert to the metaphor from the title of the present essay,
according to Chomsky, language is a cathedral erected by a single
unwitting architect, the random genetic mutation that endowed us with
the language faculty. Conversely, Luc Steels and fellow evolutionary
linguists argue that the apparent macroscopic orderliness of language is
the result of a myriad interactions of multiple individual agents, as
suggested by the the bazaar image.</p>
<p>One form that linguistic research can take under this paradigm is
formulating and running computational models which simulate the behavior
of agent populations and study the microscopic conditions, i.e. the
cognitive and physical abilities, motivations etc. of each agent,
necessary for a system like language to emerge within the population and
stabilize. By direct inspiration from Wittgenstein’s <em>Philosophical
Investigations</em>, the interactions between agents are termed “language
games” (Steels 2015, 167–8); depending on the topic being investigated,
the agents can play different types of language games with different
rules. It is openly acknowledged that such simulations represent only a
limited approximation of a well-defined subspace of the actual uses of
language. In the research to date, rules are generally definite and set
for the entire experiment, but simulating language games with fuzzy
rules remains a perfectly valid research topic within this framework, in
the Wittgensteinian spirit of allowing rules to be made up and modified
“as we go along” (Wittgenstein 2009, 44e).</p>
<p>A relatively simple game that agents can play is the so-called <em>Guessing
Game</em> (see Chap. 2 of Steels 2015 for more details). In this scenario, a
population of agents, embodied in physical robots, tries to establish a
shared lexicon and coupled ontology for a simple world consisting of
geometrical shapes. Each game is an interaction of two agents picked at
random, in the context of a scene consisting of said geometrical shapes.
One agent (the speaker) takes the initiative, selects a topic from the
scene and names it; the other (the hearer) tries to guess which object
the first one had in mind and points to it; the speaker decodes the
pointing gesture and the game succeeds if he interprets it as
referencing his original topic. If so, he acknowledges the match;
otherwise, he points at the intended topic as a repair strategy. At the
outset, neither the lexicon nor the ontology are given, only a set of
sensors and actuators (which allow the agents to interact with the
environment by taking in streams of raw perceptual data or producing
sound and pointing gestures) and very general cognitive principles.
These include an associative memory and feedback mechanisms to propagate
failures and successes in conceptualization and communication to all
components of the system and act on them.<sup id="fnref-5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> New distinctions along the
perceptual dimensions are introduced in a random fashion,<sup id="fnref-6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> but those
that lead to a successful unambiguous selection of a topic and
communicative success are strengthened over the course of many
interactions, while useless ones are dampened by lateral inhibition and
eventually pruned. At the same time, speakers create new words for
concepts that are as of yet missing from their lexicon, and hearers may
adopt them into theirs for their conceptualization of the topic the
speaker points at in case of failure. A similar feedback mechanism then
ensures that highly successful words are preferred and come to dominate
within the speech community. It is important to realize that at no time
do the individual agents share the same ontology or lexicon: newly
introduced distinctions and words are random and unique for each agent,
agents simply gradually learn which of these are useful in achieving
communicative success, which means that they naturally settle on
ontologies and lexicons that are close enough to those of others in the
population.</p>
<p>This barely scratches the surface of how all these notions must be
orchestrated for a working computer implementation of this model, not to
mention the even more elaborate agent-based language game modeling
experiments that are already being conducted, investigating for instance
the emergence of grammar (see Part III of Steels 2015 for an overview of
recent scholarship). We see that even a seemingly simple task like
establishing a shared conceptualization of reality and agreeing on names
for these concepts is a complex endeavor which relies on a highly
sophisticated (though also highly general) machinery. Another key
observation is that while agent-based models can be fully virtual,
grounding them in physical reality (cf. the use of robots with sensors
and actuators) brings additional challenges that enable researchers to
reach vital insights which would otherwise be impossible. In particular,
grounding introduces fuzziness on the sensory input channels (by virtue
of different points of view for the two robots and analog-to-digital
conversion) which the agents must cope with, or else the mechanisms they
were endowed with cannot be considered as constituting a plausible,
sufficient model of the dynamics of human language. Unlike in generative
grammar, anything that is transient, imperfect, is eminently included in
the purview of linguistic inquiry. Failures are very much part of the
dynamics that steer the evolution of language. How could it adapt to the
speakers’ changing requirements if it did not include appropriate repair
strategies? Indeed, how could it be bootstrapped at all? The reward is a
model that successfully simulates not only language emergence, but also
transmission: if virgin agents are added into an existing population,
they gradually acquire its language (see Fig. 1).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="communicative success plot" src="images/communicative_success.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Communicative success in a population of agents with a steady
influx of virgin agents and outflux of old ones (overall population size
remains the same). The game starts in phase 1 with 20 virgin agents; phases 2
and 4 show the behavior of the model at an agent renewal rate of 1/1000 games,
whereas phase 3 corresponds to a heavier rate of 1/100. (Figure from Steels
2015, 121.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, the drive to communicate, to interact, is built into the
agents, they just keep playing games as long as they can. But if it was
not, the simulation would have to be more complex and somehow elicit
this drive by introducing appropriate ecological constraints, e.g. by
requiring co-operation as a survival strategy (Steels 2015, 106).
Otherwise, the agents would have no motivation to strive for
communicative success in their mutual encounters, they would fail to
reach intersubjective alignment of their conceptual spaces and lexicons,
and language would not emerge. In other words, far from being an
afterthought, successful communication with a partner, grounded in an
external context, turns out to be a fundamental requirement to establish
the kind of dynamics which allow languages to appear.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, since it concerns itself with simulations and
computational models, this branch of evolutionary linguistics is, like
generative grammar, also highly speculative. However, unlike generative
grammar, it is a kind of speculation which considers guidance by
empirical observations a necessity, not a nuisance. Furthermore,
simulations are meant to be tested: if an agent-based model of language
emergence fails to converge on the result stipulated for that particular
experiment, the model is plain wrong and the dynamics it is trying to
put into place (cognitive strategies, feedback propagation etc.) need to
be revised. There is thus a clear-cut criterion for validity. Lastly,
even if a simulation works, an accompanying debate as to whether the
mechanisms involved are actually plausible approximations of reality is
considered an integral part of hypothesis evaluation, with evidence from
strongly empirically grounded disciplines like biology and
neurophysiology a vital element in the process.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Taking a cue from Wittgenstein’s <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, this
essay should not be construed as an attempt to replace one doctrine with
another, but to advocate a “change of attitude” (cf. McGinn 2013, 33)
which allows asking more meaningful questions about language. This being
said, on the evidence presented above, it is hard not to conclude that
Noam Chomsky is fundamentally mistaken about the corrective that is
necessary for language learning to take place. According to Chomsky, the
criterion for evaluating linguistic rules lies within a dedicated
language organ we are genetically endowed with; the innate structures
themselves embody the metric by which conjectures pertaining to
linguistic rules will be judged. By contrast, in the evolutionary
linguistics perspective, genetics provide innate structures which are
capable of random growth, but the feedback (reinforcement and pruning)
which results in steering this growth in a particular direction comes
from interactions with the environment. This theory presupposes much
less specificity in the hardware infrastructure which makes this
possible and so should be preferred both on grounds of simplicity and
flexibility of the model, not to mention that it is biologically
plausible and has been empirically verified to work.</p>
<p>In the context of science, Chomsky’s rhetorical strategy in and of
itself is dishonest: he preaches formal rigor while practicing sleight
of hand, and casually retreats to increasingly abstract ground on
reaching an impasse. He thus carves out a region in discursive space
which has no corresponding equivalent in a logically consistent
conceptual space, without which a piece of discourse can hardly
constitute a scientific theory. In other words, much like his famous
example sentence “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously”, his discourse
is grammatical but largely nonsensical under the requirements on a
system of thought which aspires to mirror reality in a coherent fashion.</p>
<p>Requirements on scientific discourse notwithstanding, we as linguists
should keep in mind that language in general is much more than a system
for encoding logical propositions. Even Wittgenstein had to resign
himself to the fact – or perhaps knew all along – that the <em>Tractatus</em>,
which he framed as the ultimate solution to all metaphysical
controversies, could only fan the flames of philosophical debate. It was
after all addressed to a diverse community of people bound perhaps
exclusively by their penchant for elaborate language games.</p>

<p>Let us pretend for a moment that language games like “poetry” or
the surrealist pastime of <em>cadavre exquis</em> do not exist; in these,
the quoted sentence could appear as perfectly valid and meaningful,
though perhaps not in the sense that Chomsky intended. “Meaningful”
in a late-Wittgensteinian perspective could be paraphrased as
“accepted by at least one involved party as a valid turn within the
context of a particular language game”.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>Arguing that this does not matter because we should be concerned
with the <em>ideal</em> speaker-hearer’s competence just takes us further
down the impasse, because now we have to determine how to delimit
the purported “ideal”.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn-3">
<p>This is the beauty of building empirically unmotivated, purely
speculative theories: at any moment, one can freely accommodate a
new element into the existing framework, substituting novelty and
amalgamation for critical evaluation.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-4">
<p>Cf. also Sampson’s riposte : “If complex properties of some aspect
of human behaviour have to be as they are as a matter of conceptual
necessity, then there is no reason to postulate complex genetically
inherited cognitive machinery determining those behaviour patterns”
(Sampson 2015, 9).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn-5">
<p>This interconnected architecture stands in stark contrast to
Chomsky’s deliberately isolationist approach: “the relation between
semantics and syntax […] can only be studied after the syntactic
structure has been determined on independent grounds” (Chomsky 2002,
17).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn-6">
<p>Wittgenstein only hints at the problem of conceptualization, but
he is prescient in realizing it is not a given: “The primary
elements [of the objects which constitute the world in this
particular language game] are the coloured squares. ‘But are these
simple?’ – I wouldn’t know what I could more naturally call a
‘simple’ in this language-game. But under other circumstances, I’d
call a monochrome square, consisting perhaps of two rectangles or of
the elements colour and shape, ‘composite’” (Wittgenstein 2009,
27e).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

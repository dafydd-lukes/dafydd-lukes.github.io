# How this works

Content is edited and added on the `source` branch, which has to be pushed
manually to the appropriate remote. When you're ready to publish, just run `make
github`. Other useful command are e.g. `make serve`. For additional tips, see
the [documentation](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/publish.html).

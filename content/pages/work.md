# Current position

I'm coordinating phonetic transcription for the ORTOFON corpus project at the
Spoken Corpora Section of the
[Institute of the Czech National Corpus](http://korpus.cz),
[Faculty of Arts](http://ff.cuni.cz),
[Charles University in Prague](http://cuni.cz). I also help out with various
data processing tasks and functionality prototyping (mainly using Python, Perl
and R).

# Projects

For more, check out
[my <span class="fa fa-github-alt"></span> GitHub profile](https://github.com/dlukes).

- [KonText Layout Switcher](http://dlukes.github.io/output/kontext-interface-tweak.html)
  • a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script to customize the interface of the KonText
  corpus manager (see link for a screenshot)
- [MluvKonk](http://trost.korpus.cz/shiny/lukes/mluvkonk) • an experimental
  viewer for spoken corpus concordances as exported from
  [KonText](https://kontext.korpus.cz), which tries to give more visual cues as
  to the structure of the dialogue; similar functionality in KonText itself is
  hopefully coming up soon!
- [CNC Maps](https://trnka.korpus.cz/~lukes/maps) • an interactive web interface
  for displaying and manipulating concordances from the ORAL series corpora on a
  map. also features a component for browsing dialect recordings along with
  descriptions.
- [TransVer](https://github.com/dlukes/trans-ver) • a transcription verifier for
  our current spoken data collection project at the Czech National Corpus.
  written in Clojure, using the wonderful
  [seesaw](https://github.com/daveray/seesaw) wrapper library around the
  horrible swing GUI toolkit.
- my MA thesis (in czech) --
  [Perceptual sensitivity to music and speech stimuli in the frequency and temporal domains](https://github.com/dlukes/diplomka#listening-test-with-music-and-speech-stimuli)
  • if you're interested in the affinities between the ways humans process
  language and music, check it out!
- [EXMARaLDA/EXAKT tutorial](https://trnka.korpus.cz/~lukes/navod) • a short
  tutorial on using the [EXAKT](http://www.exmaralda.org) corpus concordancer
  tool. mainly intended for internal use, but you might find something useful in
  there. if you speak czech, that is :) suggestions for improvement welcome!
- [PraatEdit](https://github.com/dlukes/PraatEdit) • a code editor for scripting
  the [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) speech analysis software
  environment, with syntax highlighting, written as a Java-learning project --
  so expect bugs :)

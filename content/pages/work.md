# Current position

I'm coordinating phonetic transcription for the ORTOFON corpus project at the
Spoken Corpora Section of the
[Institute of the Czech National Corpus](http://korpus.cz),
[Faculty of Arts](http://ff.cuni.cz),
[Charles University in Prague](http://cuni.cz). I also help out with various
data processing tasks and functionality prototyping (mainly using Python, Perl
and R).

# Projects

Check out [my <span class="fa fa-github-alt"></span> GitHub
profile](https://github.com/dlukes).

# Writing elsewhere

If you're interested in the affinities between people's abilities to process
language and music, check my MA thesis (in Czech): [Perceptual sensitivity to
music and speech stimuli in the frequency and temporal
domains](https://github.com/dlukes/diplomka#listening-test-with-music-and-speech-stimuli).
The repository also contains the perceptual test in
[Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) which is the meat of the research
reported on in the thesis.


Back when I thought we'd be using [EXAKT](http://www.exmaralda.org) for
querying our spoken corpora, I wrote a short [tutorial about
EXMARaLDA/EXAKT](https://trnka.korpus.cz/~lukes/navod).  It was mainly intended
for internal use, but you might find something useful in there. If you speak
czech, that is :)

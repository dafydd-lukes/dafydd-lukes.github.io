Title: about me

Author: David Luke≈°

I'm primarily a phonetician/linguist interested in programming and NLP
applications, an avid fan of Linux and a beginning user of OS X. I like Python
and [Clojure](http://www.leiningen.org) and would like to
[learn me a Haskell for great good](http://learnyouahaskell.com); I find R
useful (though convoluted on occasion) and avoid Perl as much as I can.

I work at the [Institute of the Czech National Corpus](http://www.korpus.cz),
so if you're interested in [Czech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language)
and/or [corpus linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics),
check us out! We have a nice and sleek web interface called
[KonText](https://bitbucket.org/ucnk/kontext) (with the
[manatee](http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske) corpus query engine as a back-end)
for all your Czech-related queries ;)

I hail from Prague, Czech Republic, the most beautiful city in the world, and
work and live there, though I've lived in France and Belgium for a while when I
was a kid. I play badminton and football (of the soccer persuasion -- but it's
still football) and enjoy American Jewish literature (to the point of writing
my BA thesis on Philip Roth), as well as Jon Stewart, Ricky Gervais, Stephen
Fry and several other smart people who can make me laugh. I used to play the
saxophone reasonably well, but nowadays mostly enjoy playing the guitar
atrociously bad and singing along.

As you can tell from the title of this blog (if you're a fellow aficionado), I
spent most of my teen years listening to the great music of one **Frank
Zappa**.
